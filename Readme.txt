Hey Microsoft!  Thank you for your time and consideration, as I am very interested
in working hard 4 months straight with the Microsoft Leap program!   I found out
about the oppurtunity here in Austin 24 hours before the application deadline.
So I didn't have time to whip up a Markdown resume, but I feel mine is very 
concise and hopefully won't be too much of a problem. Thanks again and
I hope to hear from you soon!  ~Anthony Pekearo
